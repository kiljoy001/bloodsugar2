# bloodsugar2 alpha
rewrite using sqlite

Thank you for your interest in this project!

Bloodsugar is a small windows form application that is used to record and chart your glucose levels over time. The data is stored in sqlite database called database.sqlite. The database is a single table called result which timestamps entries as the primary key in unix epoch time stored as a number. The result entered is stored as an text field. As such, do not use alphabetical characters as it will undoubtably crash the program.
There is also a feature where you can see all results up to the day you select via the DateTimePicker control on the left. The results are posted to the ListBox Control below.
